#### To do

- [MPL3115A2 Altitude/Pressure Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11084)


## Initial setup

### The vehicle

From a fresh install of [Raspian Stretch Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/):

Connect it to the local network via ethernet (the wireless card is used to manage it's own network)

- note the IP
- set a root password
- Run `raspi-config`
	- Under `Localisation Options`, set the proper keyboard layout.
	- Under `Advanced`, expand the filesystem if it didn't automatically do this at first boot.
	- Under `Interfacing Options`, enable `SSH` and `I2C`.
- change `PermitRootLogin` for the moment: `sed -i -E "s/^#?(PermitRootLogin)/\1 yes/" /etc/ssh/sshd_config` and `systemctl restart ssh`

Ansible will later change that `yes` to `prohibit-password`.

### The development machine

For `/etc/hosts`:

    192.168.1.XXX currant

Create and sync an SSH key (the keys I generated from macOS with OpenSSH didn't play with paramiko nicely, I had to generate the keys on the Pi and move them locally):

    ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f ~/.ssh/currant_ecdsa -b 521 -N ''
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/currant_ecdsa root@currant

For `~/.ssh/config`:

    Host currant
        User root
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/currant_ecdsa

### The vehicle again

Assuming `git`, `pipenv`, and `ansible` are installed locally; clone this repo.

The ansible playbooks will configure the rest of the vehicle; `cd` into `./ansible/` and run them

- `ansible-playbook python3.yml` installs the python version set in that file (takes like half an hour)
- `ansible-playbook setup.yml` configures the wireless network, interfaces, house-cleaning, etc

([these are the instructions](https://frillip.com/using-your-raspberry-pi-3-as-a-wifi-access-point-with-hostapd/) I used to originally configure the wireless setup)

The USB wireless card can now be used to connect to the vehicle's wireless network.
By default, the network is `currant`, as is the username. Password is `currantpw`.

Once connected via wifi, change the line in your `/etc/hosts/` to:

	172.24.1.1 currant


## Development

I open three terminal instances with [`itermocil --here`](https://github.com/TomAnthony/itermocil):

- One for git/local work (pictured left)
- One for running `ssh currant`, and once inside the vehicle, running `preflight` and then `./fly.py`. (top right)
- One for running `pipenv shell ./tower.py`, which will watch and sync `./currant/*` to `/opt/currant` on the vehicle. (bottom right)

![terminal](./assets/terminal.png)

`preflight` is `./ansible/files/preflight`

Use `./fly.py --setup-bt` to set up a bluetooth controller.
