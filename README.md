## Software

- [Python 3.6.4](https://docs.python.org/3/) with smbus2, psutils, and numpy
- [xboxdrv](https://github.com/xboxdrv/xboxdrv) for xbox controller support
- [hostapd and dnsmasq for hosting a wifi network](https://frillip.com/using-your-raspberry-pi-3-as-a-wifi-access-point-with-hostapd/)


## Setup

### From the Raspberry Pi

With a fresh install of [Raspian Stretch Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), you should:

Run `raspi-config` and;
- Under `Advanced`, expand the filesystem.
- Under `Interfacing Options`, enable SSH and I2C.

Exit, restart, set root password, note the IP, mine was `192.168.1.235`, yours may vary.

### From the development machine

Passwords are for suckers:

    ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa -N ''
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa root@192.168.1.235

Assuming `git`, `python 3.6`, [`pipenv`](https://docs.pipenv.org/) and [`ansible`](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html) are already installed locally.

Includes two ansible playbooks:

- `ansible-playbook python3.yml` installs python 3.6.4 (takes a while)
- `ansible-playbook setup.yml` configures the wireless network,

The Pi should now be broadcasting a wifi network called `flightcontroller`. Credentials are in `./ansible/files/hostapd.conf`.

For your `~/.ssh/config`:

    Host havok
        User root
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa

And `192.168.1.235 havok` in `/etc/hosts`

## Development

### Locally

`python tower.py` will watch and sync `vehicle/*` to `/opt/flightcontroller` on the Pi.

### From the Pi

    ssh havok
    cd /opt/flightcontroller
    pipenv shell
    python main.py

The initial `pipenv install` takes about 30 minutes.

### Extra

Symlink the [`.itermocil`](https://github.com/TomAnthony/itermocil) file with `ln -s $(pwd)/.itermocil ~/.itermocil/flightcontroller`

### To do

Have ansible configure the Pi python virtualenv
